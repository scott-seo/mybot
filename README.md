# Learning go by working on a pet project

There are many awesome tools like hubot but I wanted to create my own bot. My bot, no pun intended, is an automation bot that is designed to run on desktops (currently Mac OSX only).

You get to play sound, make the bot talk out loud, pop up browsers. Design focus is on adding automation to desktop environment.

Here is the list of commands I have implemented so far. I haven't implmented manual command but I will. The following commands will run in REPL. The REPL is from this awesome project. http://github.com/peterh/liner

* weather

* ssh

* gmail

* google seach

* alert

* graph

* if

* health check

* wait 

* monitor

* repeat

* debug
