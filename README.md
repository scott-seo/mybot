# Learning go by working on a pet project

There are many awesome tools like hubot but I wanted to create my own bot. My bot, no pun intended, is automation bot that is designed to run on a desktop.

You get to use play sound, make the bot talk out loud, pop up a browser. Any bot can do the same but the desktop environment is the focal point in designing.

Here is the list of things I have implemented so far.

weather

ssh

gmail

google seach

alert

graph

health check

wait 

monitor

repeat

debug
