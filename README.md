# Learning go by working on a pet project

There are many awesome tools like hubot but I wanted to create my own bot. My bot, no pun intended, is an automation bot that is designed to run on desktops.

You get to play sound, make the bot talk out loud, pop up browsers. Any bot can do the same but the desktop environment is the target platform.

Here is the list of commands I have implemented so far.

* weather

* ssh

* gmail

* google seach

* alert

* graph

* if

* health check

* wait 

* monitor

* repeat

* debug
